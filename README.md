# Hangman_Game
This project is a text-based Hangman game implemented in Python. The game offers three difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) and dynamically selects a word from a predefined list based on the chosen difficulty. It integrates with the OpenAI API to generate hints for the chosen word, enhancing the gameplay experience.
